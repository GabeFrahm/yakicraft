## Todo

- [x] Determine if Twitch or Patreon subs (Doesn't matter because Discord bot)
- [X] Determine file structure (Discord bot which uses RCON to communicate with server)
- [ ] Bot planning (should include json dictionary of UUID and Discord user)
- [ ] Web dev (ugh) MAYBE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS
- [ ] Link Twitch account and get subs. If subbed, allow one addition to whitelist or edit existing entry. (This can be a dictionary with key as Twitch id, and pair as representation of minecraft user) OAuth
